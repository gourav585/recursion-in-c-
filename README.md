<h1>recursion definition in c++</h1>
<p>In C++, recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself directly or indirectly. It's a way to break down a complex problem into smaller, similar subproblems.</p>
<h2>Key components of recursion:</h2>
<h3>Base Case:</h3>
<p>A condition that determines when the recursion should stop. Without a base case, the function would call itself endlessly, leading to a stack overflow error.</p>
<h3>Recursive Case:</h3>
<p>The part of the function that calls itself, typically with modified arguments, to solve a smaller version of the problem.</p>
<p>#include <iostream>

int factorial(int n) {
    // Base case
    if (n == 0) {
        return 1;
    } else {
        // Recursive case
        return n * factorial(n - 1);
    }
}

int main() {
    int num = 5;
    std::cout << "Factorial of " << num << " is " << factorial(num) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}</p>
<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>The factorial function calculates the factorial of a number n.</p>
<p>If n is 0, the function returns 1 (base case).</p>
<p>Otherwise, it multiplies n by the factorial of n - 1 (recursive case).</p>
<p>This continues until n reaches 0, at which point the recursion stops.</p>
